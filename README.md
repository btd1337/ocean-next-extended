# React Ocean Next Theme Extended #

![everything with the same look and feel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btd1337/vscode-ocean-next-extended-theme/master/images/screenshot.png)

This theme is inspired in the react.js's website default sintax theme.

Use the React Ocean Next theme that you already love not just in the editor, but inside the Visual Studio Code entirely.

Feel the vibes of the ocean dark theme inside every file, terminal, file list, popup and error.
